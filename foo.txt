{key = {key=itemtext, value=item_cost}, value = amountofitmes}
dict is outer dictionary, and you loop trough both its keys and values
For ruby it is: hash.each do |key, array|
dictionary.each|key, value|
    key = {key=itemtext, value=item_cost}
    cost = key[key.keys[0]]
    VALUE = amountofitmes


{a => b, c => b} where a is a value and b is a value
a => {"Sponge cake" => 2.00}
